        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone! My name is Brent, and I'm new to the web development world. I'm excited to get my start in this new chapter, bringing my experience from my previous "lives".</p>
        <p>I have come from a wide array of backgrounds to join this part of the workforce. Notably, I've been an operations and logistics coordinator for a robotics company, a mortgage broker, and a ticket broker, all in a span of 20 years. While each of these jobs were pretty different, they have all taught me lessons that I look forward to bringing to the table here.</p>
        <p>In addition to my work life, I bring with me several passions from my personal life. I've been a musician for more than 30 years, playing drums and percussion in all sorts of bands and ensembles. I also have a passion for working in my kitchen, cooking up a wide variety of dishes, from a wide variety of cuisines, for my family to enjoy. I look forward to bringing the same energy and creativity I've used in my musical and culinary life to this project as well.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to join a team of coders where we can collaborate on projects, bounce ideas off each other and learn from each other's experiences. Working together as a team, there's no end to what we can bring to the table!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://bsgauthierwebdev.github.io/Brewpub-Locater-API-Project/">Brewery Tour Creater</a></h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BsgauthierWebDev/Brewpub-Locater-API-Project/master/Screenshots/screenshot-opening.jpg" alt="Placeholder Image #1">
        <p>For my API hack project, I decided to create an app that would search a user-defined area for breweries, brewpubs, bottling houses and the like. The user can then select one of the locations, and the app will reorganize the list based on the proximity to the starting point.</p>
        <p>While the page is constructed using HTML and CSS, the main functionality is in the Javascript and JQuery, including a function to calculate the distance between points based on the latitude and longitude of the locations.</p>
        <p>You can access the code through my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/BsgauthierWebDev/Brewpub-Locater-API-Project">here</a>.</p>

       <h3><a href="https://bsgauthierwebdev.github.io/Intro-Page/">Introduction Page</a></h3>
        <img src="images/coding-1.jpg" alt="Placeholder Image #1">
        <p>This is the first page I created for this curriculum. I originally created the project in REPL.IT and imported the code over to my GitBub repository. It has a lot of the same basic structure of the page you see here, but as you can see I have refined my style and technique.</p>
        <p>The main points of this project were to learn about CSS styling and creating a layout, as well as adding images and live links to a web page. I learned how to format the textof the page; changing the font styles and sizes. I also learned how to create links to additional pages.</p>
        <p>You can access the code through my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/BsgauthierWebDev/Intro-Page">here</a>.</p>

        <img src="images/coding-2.jpg" alt="Placeholder Image #2">
        <p>This is the second project I completed for the Thinkful curriculum. I originally created the project in REPL.IT and imported the code over to my GitHub repository. For this project, I created a functional email contact form and set it up to send the messages directly to my inbox.</p>
        <p>While working on this project, I learned about flex layout, creating placeholder boxes for text and how to create active and responsive forms to link the Contact Me page directly to my email address.</p>
        <p>You can access the code through my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/BsgauthierWebDev/Email-Form">here</a>.</p>
