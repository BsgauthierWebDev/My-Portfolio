        <h2>Hello, I'm Brent Gauthier!</h2>
        <p>Let me tell you a little about myself, both professionally and personally. I'll give you an idea of the skills I have, as well as the passions I bring to the table.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to join a team of coders where we can collaborate on projects, bounce ideas off each other and learn from each others' experiences. Working together as a team, there's no end to what we can bring to the table!</p>
        <p>Please feel free to share a little about yourself as well, so we can get to know one another.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Please allow myself to introduce... myself. My name is Brent, and I'm new to the web development world. I'm excited to get my start in this new chapter, bringing my experience from my previous "lives".</p>
        <p>I come from a wide array of backgrounds to join this part of the workforce. Notably, I've been an operations and logistics coordinator for a robotics company, a mortgage broker and a ticket broker, all in a span of 20 years. While each of these jobs were pretty different, they have all taught me lessons that I look forward to bringing to the table here.</p>
        <p>In addition to my work life, I bring with me several passions from my personal life. I've been a musician for more than 30 years, playing drums and percussion in all sorts of bands and ensembles. I also have a passion for working in my kitchen, cooking up a wide variety of dishes, from a wide variety of cuisines, for my family to enjoy. I look forward to bringing the same energy and creativity I've used in my musical and culinary life to this project as well.</p>
